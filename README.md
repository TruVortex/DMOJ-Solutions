# *STILL UPLOADING SOLUTIONS*
## DISCLAIMER
I'm not that good at programming and these solutions are definately not optimal. Also, I'm aware that my naming scheme wouldn't work for an actual file but that's because I put my solutions directly into DMOJ and I'm too lazy to change the class name. :shrug:

### Language
These solutions are in Java 8 (with a few exceptions).

**WHY?**

It's the version  I've learned, and I'm too lazy to learn another version. Also, I'am most proficient in Java although I know C++, Python 3, and a little C and C++ and C are VERY unsafe/unstable.

**IDE**

My IDE is Netbeans. ***FIGHT ME***
