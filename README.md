# *STILL UPLOADING SOLUTIONS*
## DISCLAIMER
I'm not that good at programming and these solutions are definately not optimal. Also, I'm aware that my naming scheme wouldn't work for an actual file but that's because I put my solutions directly into DMOJ and I'm too lazy to change the class name. :shrug:

### Language
These solutions are in Java 8 or C++.

**WHY?**

Why not?

**IDE**

My IDEs are Visual Studio and Netbeans.
