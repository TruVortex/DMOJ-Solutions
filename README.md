# *STILL UPLOADING SOLUTIONS*
## DISCLAIMER
I'm not that good at programming and these solutions are definately not optimal. Also, I'm aware that my naming scheme wouldn't work for an actual file but that's because I put them into DMOJ and I'm too lazy to change the class name. :shrug:

### Language
These solutions are in Java 8.

**WHY?**

Because there's more foward compatability than later versions and lots of things have been deprecated in Java 8 so Java 7 isn't as forward compatible. Furthermore, I am most proficient in Java although I know C++, some C, and very little Python 3. Also C++ and C are VERY unsafe/unstable.

**IDE**

My IDE is Netbeans.
